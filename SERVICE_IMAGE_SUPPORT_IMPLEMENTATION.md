# Service Image Support Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of image support for services in the Queen's Glam application. The feature allows administrators to upload and manage images for services, enhancing the visual presentation of services in both the admin dashboard and customer-facing pages.

## Database Changes

### Services Table Enhancement
```sql
-- Add image_url field to services table (TEXT type for longer image data URLs)
ALTER TABLE services 
ADD COLUMN image_url TEXT;

-- Add comment to document the field
COMMENT ON COLUMN services.image_url IS 'URL of the service image for display purposes (supports long data URLs)';
```

### TypeScript Types Update
The `services` table type in `types/database.ts` has been updated to include the `image_url` field:

```typescript
services: {
  Row: {
    id: string
    name: string
    description: string | null
    category_id: string | null
    price: number
    duration_minutes: number
    image_url: string | null  // NEW FIELD
    is_active: boolean
    created_at: string
    updated_at: string
  }
  // ... Insert and Update types also updated
}
```

## Components Updated

### 1. EditServiceModal.tsx
**New Features:**
- Image upload functionality with drag-and-drop support
- Image preview with remove option
- File validation (images only, up to 10MB)
- Loading states during upload

**Key Functions:**
- `handleImageUpload()`: Processes image files and converts to data URLs
- `handleImageChange()`: Handles file input changes and creates previews
- Enhanced form submission to include image URL

**UI Elements:**
- Image preview section with remove button
- Drag-and-drop upload area
- Loading indicators during upload process

### 2. AddServiceModal.tsx
**New Features:**
- Image upload functionality identical to EditServiceModal
- Optional image upload during service creation
- Preview and remove functionality

**Key Functions:**
- Same image handling functions as EditServiceModal
- Enhanced service creation to include image URL

### 3. Services.tsx (Dashboard Table)
**New Features:**
- Image column in services table
- Thumbnail display for services with images
- Fallback icon for services without images
- Responsive image sizing

**UI Elements:**
- New "Image" column header
- 48x48px thumbnail images with rounded corners
- Fallback icon (ImageIcon) for services without images

## Image Upload Implementation

### Current Implementation
The current implementation uses client-side image processing with data URLs:

```typescript
const handleImageUpload = async (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = () => {
      resolve(reader.result as string);
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  });
};
```

### Future Enhancements
For production use, consider implementing:

1. **Supabase Storage Integration:**
   ```typescript
   const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
     .from('service-images')
     .upload(`${serviceId}/${fileName}`, file);
   ```

2. **Image Optimization:**
   - Resize images to standard dimensions
   - Compress images for better performance
   - Generate multiple sizes for responsive design

3. **CDN Integration:**
   - Use a CDN for faster image delivery
   - Implement lazy loading for better performance

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Adding a Service with Image:**
   - Open the "Add Service" modal
   - Fill in service details
   - Click the upload area or drag an image file
   - Preview the image and remove if needed
   - Submit the form

2. **Editing a Service Image:**
   - Open the "Edit Service" modal
   - Current image will be displayed if available
   - Upload a new image to replace the existing one
   - Remove the image by clicking the X button
   - Save changes

3. **Viewing Services with Images:**
   - Navigate to the Services dashboard
   - Images are displayed as thumbnails in the table
   - Services without images show a placeholder icon

### File Requirements
- **Supported Formats:** PNG, JPG, GIF
- **Maximum Size:** 10MB
- **Recommended Dimensions:** 400x300px or larger
- **Aspect Ratio:** Flexible, images will be cropped to fit

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Images are stored as data URLs (base64) in the database
- Consider implementing proper image storage for production
- Implement image compression and optimization

### Security
- File type validation on client and server side
- File size limits to prevent abuse
- Sanitize file names and metadata

### Accessibility
- Alt text is automatically generated from service names
- Fallback icons for services without images
- Keyboard navigation support for upload areas

## Migration Notes

### Database Migration
Run the SQL migration to add the image_url field:
```bash
# Execute the migration file
psql -d your_database -f add-service-image-field.sql
```

### Code Deployment
1. Update the database types
2. Deploy the updated components
3. Test image upload functionality
4. Verify existing services display correctly

## Future Roadmap

1. **Image Management:**
   - Bulk image upload
   - Image cropping and editing tools
   - Multiple images per service

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement proper image storage
   - Add image caching
   - Lazy loading for large lists

3. **User Experience:**
   - Drag-and-drop reordering
   - Image galleries for services
   - Social media sharing with images
