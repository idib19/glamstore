**Code Location**: Lines 259-285
```typescript
// Send appointment confirmation (automatically sends admin notification too)
await emailService.sendAppointmentConfirmation({
  customerName: `${customerForm.first_name} ${customerForm.last_name}`,
  customerEmail: customerForm.email,
  serviceName: selectedService.name,
  appointmentDate: selectedDate,
  appointmentTime: selectedTime,
  duration: selectedService.duration_minutes,

  customerEmail: checkoutData.email,
  orderNumber: order.order_number,
  orderTotal: order.total_amount,

if (appointment.customers && appointment.services) {
  await emailService.sendAppointmentCancellation({
    customerName: `${appointment.customers.first_name} ${appointment.customers.last_name}`,
    customerEmail: appointment.customers.email,
    serviceName: appointment.services.name,
    appointmentDate: appointment.appointment_date,
    appointmentTime: appointment.start_time,
    duration: appointment.services.duration_minutes,

**Code Location**: Lines 200-230
```typescript
// Check if appointment is being cancelled
const isBeingCancelled = appointment.status !== 'cancelled' && formData.status === 'cancelled';
const isStatusChanged = appointment.status !== formData.status;

if (isBeingCancelled) {
  // Send cancellation email
  await emailService.sendAppointmentCancellation({...});
} else if (isStatusChanged && formData.status === 'confirmed') {
