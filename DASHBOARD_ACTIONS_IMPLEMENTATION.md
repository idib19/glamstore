# Dashboard Actions Implementation

This document describes the implementation of action buttons and database functions for the admin dashboard sections: Services, Orders, and Appointments.

## Overview

The dashboard now includes fully functional CRUD operations for:
- **Services**: Add, edit, and delete services
- **Orders**: View and edit order status and details
- **Appointments**: Add, edit, and cancel appointments

## Components Created

### Service Management
- `AddServiceModal.tsx` - Modal for creating new services
- `EditServiceModal.tsx` - Modal for editing existing services

### Order Management
- `EditOrderModal.tsx` - Modal for editing order status and details

### Appointment Management
- `AddAppointmentModal.tsx` - Modal for creating new appointments
- `EditAppointmentModal.tsx` - Modal for editing existing appointments

### Utility Components
- `ConfirmDialog.tsx` - Reusable confirmation dialog for delete operations

## Database Integration

### Services API
- `servicesApi.getAll()` - Fetch all active services
- `servicesApi.create()` - Create new service
- `servicesApi.update()` - Update existing service
- `servicesApi.delete()` - Soft delete service (sets is_active to false)

### Orders API
- `ordersApi.getAll()` - Fetch all orders with customer and item details
- `ordersApi.update()` - Update order status and details
- `ordersApi.delete()` - Soft delete order (sets status to cancelled)

### Appointments API
- `appointmentsApi.getAll()` - Fetch all appointments with customer and service details
- `appointmentsApi.create()` - Create new appointment
- `appointmentsApi.update()` - Update appointment details
- `appointmentsApi.delete()` - Cancel appointment (sets status to cancelled)

## Features Implemented

## Database Schema Requirements

The implementation requires the following database tables and relationships:

### Services
```sql
- services (id, name, description, category_id, price, duration_minutes, is_active)
- service_categories (id, name, description, slug, is_active)
```

### Orders
```sql
- orders (id, order_number, customer_id, status, payment_status, total_amount, notes)
- order_items (id, order_id, product_id, product_name, quantity, unit_price, total_price)
- customers (id, first_name, last_name, email, phone)
```

### Appointments
```sql
- appointments (id, customer_id, service_id, appointment_date, start_time, end_time, status, notes, total_price)
- customers (id, first_name, last_name, email, phone)
- services (id, name, price, duration_minutes)
```
